        <article>
          <p>
            The CSS Box Model is the foundation of how elements are structured
            and spaced on a webpage. It represents the space taken up by an
            element, consisting of the following areas:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Content: The innermost area, where text or other content is
              displayed.
            </li>
            <li>Padding: The space between the content and the border.</li>
            <li>Border: The edge surrounding the padding and content.</li>
            <li>
              Margin: The outermost space, separating the element from others.
            </li>
          </ol>

      <section class="main-section" id="Cascade_and_Specificity">
        <header>Cascade and Specificity</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            The CSS Cascade determines which styles are applied when multiple
            rules target the same element. It resolves conflicts using priority
            based on <strong>specificity</strong>, <strong>importance</strong>,
            and <strong>source order</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Styles with higher specificity or marked with !important override
            others. If rules have the same weight, the one defined later in the
            code takes precedence.
          </p>
          <p>
            Specificity is a hierarchy system in CSS that determines which rule
            is applied when multiple rules target the same element. It assigns a
            weight to selectors based on their type:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Inline styles (style attribute) have the highest specificity.
            </li>
            <li>
              IDs (#id) have more weight than classes (.class), attributes, or
              pseudo-classes (:hover).
            </li>
            <li>
              Elements (e.g., div, p) and pseudo-elements (::before) have the
              lowest weight.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <pre>
<code>
  /* Lowest specificity (element selector) */
  p {
    color: blue;
  }

  /* Higher specificity (class selector) */
  .highlight {
    color: green;
  }

  /* Even higher specificity (ID selector) */
  #important {
    color: red;
  }

  /* Highest specificity (inline style) */</code>

        <header>Inheritance</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            In CSS, certain properties, like text-related styles (e.g., color,
            font-family), are inherited by child elements from their parent.
            Non-inherited properties, like margin or padding, need to be
            explicitly defined for child elements.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can force inheritance using the inherit keyword or override it
            with custom values. Inheritance simplifies styling for nested
            elements.
          </p>
          <pre>
<code>
  body {
    color: blue; /* Inherited by child elements */
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  }

  h1 {
    font-size: 2rem; /* Not inherited, defined explicitly */
  }

  p {
    color: inherit; /* Forces inheritance */
  }</code>

      <section class="main-section" id="Colors">
        <header>Colors</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            Colors in CSS are used to style elements, set backgrounds, borders,
            text, and more. CSS supports different types of color notations for
            flexibility, allowing designers to choose based on their preferences
            or requirements.
          </p>
          <h3>Types of Colors in CSS</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Named Colors: Predefined color names like red, blue, green, etc.
              (e.g., color: red;).
            </li>
            <li>
              Hexadecimal Colors: Represented as #RRGGBB or #RGB (e.g., #FF5733
              for orange).
            </li>
            <li>
              RGB and RGBA: Defined by Red, Green, Blue values, with optional
              Alpha for transparency (e.g., rgb(255, 87, 51) or rgba(255, 87,
              51, 0.5)).
            </li>
            <li>
              HSL and HSLA: Defined by Hue, Saturation, and Lightness, with
              optional Alpha (e.g., hsl(11, 100%, 60%) or hsla(11, 100%, 60%,
              0.5)).
            </li>
          </ol>
          <pre>
<code>
  .named-color {
    color: red; /* Named color */
  }

  .hex-color {
    color: #1E90FF; /* Hexadecimal color */
  }

  .rgb-color {
    color: rgb(34, 139, 34); /* RGB color */
  }

  .rgba-color {
    background-color: rgba(34, 139, 34, 0.5); /* RGBA with transparency */
  }

  .hsl-color {
    color: hsl(240, 100%, 50%); /* HSL color */
  }</code>

      <section class="main-section" id="Flexbox_Layout">
        <header>Flexbox Layout</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            Flexbox is a CSS layout model designed for creating flexible and
            responsive one-dimensional layouts. It allows you to align and
            distribute space among items within a container, either horizontally
            (row) or vertically (column).
          </p>
          <img src="./img/flexbox.png" alt="flexbox" />
          <p>
            Key properties include display: flex, justify-content (for
            horizontal alignment), align-items (for vertical alignment), and
            flex-direction (to set row or column).
          </p>
          <p>
            Flexbox simplifies tasks like centering content, creating
            equal-width columns, or reordering elements. It works by defining a
            flex container and its child flex items, which can grow, shrink, or
            maintain their size based on available space.
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>
  .container {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
  }</code>

        <header>Grid Layout</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            CSS Grid is a powerful two-dimensional layout system for creating
            complex, grid-based designs. It allows you to define rows and
            columns and place items precisely within the grid.
          </p>
          <img src="./img/grid.png" alt="grid" />
          <p>
            Key properties include <strong>display: grid</strong>,
            <strong>grid-template-columns</strong>,
            <strong>grid-template-rows</strong>, and <strong>gap</strong> (for
            spacing between items). Grid enables responsive layouts without
            relying on floats or positioning.
          </p>
          <p>
            It works by defining a grid container and its child grid items,
            which can span multiple rows or columns. Grid is ideal for building
            modern, structured layouts like dashboards or magazine-style
            designs.
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>
  .container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
    gap: 10px;
  }</code>

            Responsive Design is an approach to web development that ensures
            websites adapt to different screen sizes and devices. It uses
            flexible layouts, images, and CSS media queries to adjust the design
            dynamically.
          </p>
          <p>
            Media queries allow you to apply specific styles based on device
            characteristics like width, height, or orientation. Key techniques
            include using relative units (like percentages or em), flexible
            grids, and responsive images.
          </p>
          <p>
            The goal is to provide an optimal viewing experience across
            desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. Responsive design is
            essential for modern web development, improving usability and
            accessibility.
